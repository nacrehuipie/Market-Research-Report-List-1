<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Geothermal Power and Heat Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Loop System</li><li>Open Loop System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Geothermal power and heat pump markets consist of two main types: closed loop systems and open loop systems. Closed loop systems circulate a refrigerant or water through underground pipes, absorbing heat from the ground to provide heating or cooling efficiently. Open loop systems utilize groundwater directly, drawing it from wells for heating or cooling before returning it to the source. Both systems leverage geothermal energy, but their operation and installation vary based on water availability and site conditions.</p></p>
