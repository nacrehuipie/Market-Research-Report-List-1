<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Respiratory Tract Humidifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Type</li><li>Passive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical respiratory tract humidifier market can be divided into two primary types: active and passive humidifiers. Active humidifiers use mechanisms such as heated plates or nebulizers to actively warm and moisten the inspired air, ensuring optimal humidity levels for patients requiring respiratory support. In contrast, passive humidifiers rely on moisture recovery from exhaled breath to humidify incoming air, making them more energy-efficient and simpler in design. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing patient comfort and respiratory function during treatment.</p></p>
