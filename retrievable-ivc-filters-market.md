<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retrievable IVC Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tethered Filter</li><li>Unrestricted-type Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are designed to prevent pulmonary embolism by capturing blood clots. The market consists of two main types: tethered filters, which have a retrieval mechanism allowing for removal after the risk of thrombosis has passed, and unrestricted-type filters, which lack this mechanism and are typically permanent. Tethered filters offer flexibility and safety, while unrestricted filters may be chosen for long-term access management in high-risk patients. Both types serve distinct clinical needs in treating venous thromboembolism.</p></p>
